Mars Exploration: time complexity of the code is O(n) where n is the length of the string because the code only iterates through the entirely of the string once and all the other operations of incrementing value and checking for conditions are constant time. Space complexity of the algorithm is T(1) because it uses a constant amount of space being just the variable sum while it takes no additional memory space regardless of the size of the input string. 

Two Strings: the algorithm works by checking for common letters in both strings as we only have to return yes or no if a common substring exists. The worst case for this algorithm is that the common substring is at the very end of the string for both string inputs. In this case the time complexity is O(n^2) assuming that the 2 strings have length n. If not time complexity is O(n*m) where n is the size of string 1 and m is the size of string 2. We know that the space complexity of recrusive algorithm is determined by the recursive depth of the algorithm, which in our case can be the entire length of the string. If we have 2 strings of different sizes then the space complexity of the algorithm will be the larger of the 2 and hence we have that T(max(n, m)) where n is the size of string 1 and m is the size of string 2.
